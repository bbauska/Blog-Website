# Blog-Website
In this article, we will be creating a Blog website using JavaScript. The user can Create and Delete a post which will be displayed on the home page. The create Post modal has 
3 input fields that are "Title", "Category" and "Description" of the Blog post with a Responsive Design. We will be using HTML to structure our project, CSS for designing 
purposes and JavaScript will be used to provide the required functionality.
